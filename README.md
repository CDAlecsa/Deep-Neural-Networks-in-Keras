# Fashion MNIST in Keras

This a repository which contains some basic codes for training the Fashion MNIST dataset from Keras. I have done this in Jupyter Notebook. It contains the following :

- loading the training and testing data from Keras
- analyzing the prediction errors from the classification problem
- include dropout via some given dropout rate
- adaptive learning rate procedure (e.g. exponential decay, decay stepsize with power elements)
- loss and accuracy plots
- learning rate decay plot
- early stopping procedure
